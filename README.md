# node-unusual-effects
A node module for finding Team Fortress 2 unusual effects and retrieving their images from Backpack.tf

## TODO
1. Find Unusual effects by name and ID. (findEffectByName, findEffectById)
2. Retreive the Unsual effect's images from Backpack.tf (Should return an object with small, medium and large image sizes).
3. A method for extracting the Unusual effect's name from an EconItem object's description.
4. Rename and return a new Item name to match the standard used by Backpack.tf (Unusual Team Captain should become Burning Flames Team Captain).
5. Setup a testing environment for the package (npm run test).
6. Create a set of examples and use cases for the package (Use cases). 
7. Create a Wiki page for the documentation (Setup & Installation, Core functionality & methods).
8. Add the necessary details to the README.md file (Introduction, Installation, Usage, Documentation).
9. Publish the package.
